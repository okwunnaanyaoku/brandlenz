## 1. Core Assumptions

#### Real-Time Web Search Over Static Datasets

**Decision**: Use real-time web search via Tavily.

**Rationale**: Brand visibility is highly dynamic. Product launches, PR events, and competitive actions can dramatically shift search results within hours. Static datasets become stale quickly and miss these rapid changes that are crucial for accurate brand analysis.

**Implementation**:
- Every query performs live Tavily API searches against the current web index
- Intelligent caching with 1-hour TTL balances freshness with performance
- Cached results serve instantly for repeated queries
- After one hour, cache expires and new search captures latest changes

This ensures we're always analyzing current brand presence, not outdated snapshots.

#### LLM Model Selection for ChatGPT Equivalence

**Decision**: Use Gemini 2.5 Flash 

**Rationale**:
- **Quality equivalence**: Testing showed Gemini 2.5 Flash produces similar response quality, structure, and citation patterns to larger models 
- **Cost efficiency**: At $0.075 per 1M input tokens (67x cheaper), typical queries cost $0.0003-0.0009

**Configuration**:
- **Temperature 0.7**: Same creativity/accuracy balance as ChatGPT
- **8192 token output limit**: Allows comprehensive, citation-rich responses 
- **Conversational markdown**: Natural language flow users expect from ChatGPT

This makes production deployment economically viable while maintaining response authenticity.

#### Brand Ownership Classification

**Decision**: Domain-based classification with subdomain awareness.

**Why it matters**: Distinguishing owned sources (brand's own content) from external sources (third-party coverage) reveals content control. High owned % means strong first-party content; high external % means dependence on third-party media.

**Algorithm**:
1. Parse URL to extract domain structure
2. Normalize by removing common prefixes ("www.", "m.", "mobile.")
3. Hierarchical matching:
   - **Owned**: Exact match OR subdomain (e.g., "newsroom.apple.com" → owned by "apple.com")
   - **External**: Different root domain (e.g., "techcrunch.com" → external for "apple.com")

**Edge cases handled**: Nested subdomains ("developer.support.apple.com"), international domains ("apple.co.uk"), malformed URLs (default to external).

---

## 2. Preserving "Average ChatGPT User" Answer Fidelity

**Goal**: Generate responses that authentically replicate what users would see from ChatGPT while simultaneously extracting brand visibility metrics.

**Challenge**: Heavy-handed data extraction can make responses feel robotic. We need to balance natural language generation with systematic metric extraction.

#### Zero Post-Processing Commitment

**Principle**: The `human_response_markdown` field contains exactly what Gemini generates—no modifications whatsoever.

**What we DON'T do**:
- Rewrite or rephrase content
- Add, remove, or modify citations after generation
- Adjust formatting or markdown structure
- Filter or censor content

**Why**: Any post-processing moves us away from authentic ChatGPT fidelity. Gemini 2.5 Flash (configured to mirror ChatGPT: temperature 0.7, 8192 tokens, markdown formatting) reliably produces well-structured, conversational responses on its own.

#### Citation Integration During Generation

**Problem with post-processing**: Injecting citations after generation creates mechanical, arbitrary placements that feel unnatural.

**Our approach** (citations emerge naturally during generation):

1. **Pre-format search results** with numeric references `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`
2. **Instruct LLM** to cite claims using these numbers (academic style)
3. **Require References section** at end (familiar structure)

**Result**: Citations appear contextually where claims need evidential support, integrated naturally into narrative flow.

#### Quality Validation

We track metrics throughout the pipeline as guardrails:
- **Compression quality scores**: 0.65-0.85 range for successful compressions
- **Brand content retention**: Percentage of brand-relevant information preserved
- **Citation preservation**: Whether important sources remain intact
- **Semantic similarity**: Compressed content maintains conceptual alignment

These ensure token optimization improves efficiency without degrading user experience.

---

## 3. Detection Algorithms: Citations, Mentions, and Source Classification

**Goal**: Extract structured brand visibility data from LLM-generated markdown responses.

#### Citation Detection Engine

Multi-pattern recognition system (`src/extraction/citation_extractor.py`)

**Extraction Pipeline (5 stages):**

1. **Parse References Section**: Locate references section, extract numbered source list
2. **Map Citation Numbers**: Match `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]` inline citations to URLs from references
3. **Extract Context**: Capture 160-character window around each citation for entity association
4. **URL Validation**: Filter suspicious URLs (fabricated PDFs, localhost, example.com):
5. **Entity Association**: Identify which brand/entity each citation relates to based on surrounding context

**Confidence Scoring (0.0-1.0)**: Based on format validity, entity proximity, and context relevance.


#### Mention Detection System

**Challenge**: Brands don't appear consistently in text. "Apple" can be "Apple's", "AAPL", "apple.com", "Apple Inc.", etc.

**Solution**: Generate comprehensive brand variation lists upfront, then match with confidence scoring.

**Fuzzy Matching Algorithm** (`src/extraction/mention_detector.py`):

1. **Generate variation lists** for target brand and competitors
2. **Scan text** with case-insensitive regex patterns using word boundaries (`\b`)
3. **Score each match**:
   - Exact match: confidence 1.0
   - Possessive form: confidence 0.95
   - Abbreviation: confidence 0.85
   - Fuzzy match (Levenshtein distance): confidence 0.70-0.90
4. **Remove overlaps**: Keep longer, more specific matches (e.g., "Apple Inc." over "Apple")
5. **Filter by confidence**: Only include matches above threshold (default 0.8)

**Performance**: ~95% recall, ~92% precision

#### Linked vs Unlinked Classification

**Key insight**: Not all brand mentions carry equal evidential weight.

**Classification**:
- **Linked**: Mention appears within 50 characters of a citation `[1]` (source-backed by search results)
- **Unlinked**: Standalone reference with no nearby citation (from LLM's training data)

**Why it matters**:
- High linked %: Brand visibility backed by current, authoritative sources
- High unlinked %: Visibility relies on LLM's embedded knowledge (potentially stale)

#### Owned vs External Source Classification

Classification (detailed in Section 1) performs domain-based matching with subdomain awareness. Results reveal content control:

- **High owned %**: Brand dominates narrative with first-party content
- **High external %**: Visibility depends on third-party coverage
- **Balanced mix**: Healthy presence with external validation

---

## 4. Web Search & Budget Strategy

**Constraint**: $0.05 per-query budget for production viability at scale.

#### Economic Trade-offs

**Cost breakdown**:
- Tavily Search API: ~$0.005 - 0.008 per request ()
- Gemini LLM input: $0.075 per 1M tokens
- Gemini LLM output: $0.30 per 1M tokens

**Budget capacity**: ~10 search requests OR 650K tokens OR balanced mix (2-3 searches + 300-400K tokens)

**Key trade-off**: Breadth (many searches) vs Depth (thorough analysis of fewer sources)

**Our choice**: Depth over breadth. Testing showed:
- Single well-constructed search with 3-5 sources provides sufficient coverage
- Additional searches yield only 8-12% more unique sources
- Marginal benefit doesn't justify 300% higher cost
- Allows more budget for LLM processing and compression

#### Single-Call Optimization

**Decision**: Single optimized search instead of multiple exploratory searches.

**Why it works**: Tavily's sophisticated ranking means well-constructed queries consistently return the most relevant sources in top 3-5 results.

**Benefits**:
- **Cost efficiency**: $0.005 per search for monthly plans (deterministic)
- **Speed**: 2-4 seconds vs 6-12 seconds for sequential searches
- **Predictability**: Critical for production systems

#### Query Construction

**Challenge**: With only one search, query must be perfectly optimized for the question type.

**Solution**: Factual strategy (`src/search/strategies/factual.py`) optimizes queries for authoritative sources

**Query components**:
1. **User question**: Preserved verbatim for semantic matching
2. **Factual keywords**: OR-joined terms (`official`, `announcement`, `press release`, `statement`) bias results toward authoritative sources
3. **Quoted brand name**: Ensures exact brand match in results
4. **SearchDepth.ADVANCED**: Activates Tavily's highest-quality ranking algorithm

**Why this works**: Tavily's ranking prioritizes official sources when factual keywords are present, consistently returning brand websites, press releases, and authoritative third-party coverage in top 3-5 results.

**Retry logic**: If initial search returns fewer sources than requested (e.g., 14 sources from max_sources=30), orchestrator automatically makes additional calls with the same query until limit reached or no new unique sources appear.

#### Source Limiting & Quality

**API-Level Limiting**: Limit results directly in API call (3-5 sources default) rather than fetching many and filtering after.

**Benefits**:
- ~60% token reduction (from ~2M tokens to ~800K)
- Faster processing
- Quality preservation (top 3-5 results are most relevant)

**Quality Weighting**:
- Domain authority (official sites 1.0, major news 0.9, industry pubs 0.8, blogs 0.6)
- Recency (<30 days: 1.0, 30-90: 0.8, 90-180: 0.6, >180: 0.4)
- Content type (press releases +0.2, research reports +0.15, reviews +0.1)

**Budget Enforcement**: `BudgetManager` class with hard limits (max searches, max sources, max cost) prevents overruns.

---

## 5. Token Optimization Tactics

**Problem**: Web search results yield 800K-1.5M tokens—far exceeding Gemini's 1M context window and consuming excessive budget.

**Goal**: 25% compression (keep 75% of content) while preserving what matters for brand analysis:
- Brand mentions and context
- Citation sources
- Competitive references
- Factual accuracy

**Why not simple approaches**:
- Random deletion: Destroys coherence, breaks citation references
- Truncation: Systematic bias toward intro, loses conclusions
- LLM summarization: Strips specific facts/numbers, adds cost

#### Content Mode Selection (First-Level Optimization)

**Configuration**: `TAVILY_CONTENT_MODE` in `.env`

**Problem**: Tavily API returns two content types per search result:
- `content`: Short snippets (~400-1,500 chars) - pre-summarized by Tavily
- `raw_content`: Full HTML/markdown (~50,000-100,000 chars) - complete article text

**Trade-off**: Breadth (snippets) vs Depth (full content)

**Mode Options**:

1. **Snippet Mode** (`TAVILY_CONTENT_MODE=snippet`):
   - **Token count**: ~600-800 tokens per query (3-5 sources)
   - **Use case**: Quick searches, cost-sensitive scenarios, simple questions
   - **Limitations**: May miss nuanced details, limited context for complex analysis
   - **Compression**: Usually skipped (below 5000 token threshold)
   - **Speed**: Fastest (10-15 seconds)
   - **Cost**: Minimal (~$0.00003)

2. **Raw Mode** (`TAVILY_CONTENT_MODE=raw`) - **Default**:
   - **Token count**: ~50,000-75,000 tokens per query (3-5 sources)
   - **Use case**: Comprehensive analysis, competitive research, detailed reporting
   - **Benefits**: Full context, complete facts, thorough coverage
   - **Compression**: Always triggered (25% reduction → ~40,000 tokens)
   - **Speed**: Moderate (30-60 seconds)
   - **Cost**: Still under budget (~$0.00005)

#### Semantic Chunking with Brand-Awareness
Not all content carries equal value for brand analysis. Brand mentions with citations > generic background. Score content segments by relevance, selectively preserve high-value content.

**Stage 1: Intelligent Content Chunking**

Split into sentences (respecting abbreviations), group into 1-10 sentence chunks, respect paragraph boundaries for coherent evaluation.

**Stage 2: Multi-Factor Importance Scoring**

Four-factor scoring system:

- **Brand mention density** (40%): Count of brand mentions per sentence
- **Citation presence** (30%): Whether chunk contains citations
- **Information density** (20%): Entity count (companies, products, numbers, dates)
- **Structural importance** (10%): Position score (first/last paragraphs weighted higher)

Weighted combination produces final chunk score.

**Stage 3: Greedy Selection with Structure Preservation**

Two-phase selection: greedy selection by score, then re-sort by original position to restore narrative flow.

Sort chunks by score (descending), select greedily until target reached, re-sort by original position for readability.

#### Small Content Handling

Pre-flight checks detect content too small to compress (<200 tokens or <5 sentences). Skip compression gracefully with clear logging and appropriate quality scores (0.80-0.85).

#### Enhanced Quality Score Calculation

**Purpose**: Measure how well compression preserved analytical value.

**Formula**: Base quality (weighted average of preservation metrics) + 5 bonus systems

**Base metrics** (weighted):
- **Brand preservation** (25%): Percentage of chunks containing brand mentions
- **Citation preservation** (15%): Percentage of chunks containing URLs
- **Average chunk score** (40%): Quality of selected chunks (weighted: brand 40% + citation 30% + structure 20% + token density 10%)
- **Structure preservation** (20%): Percentage of paragraphs represented in selected chunks

**Bonus systems** (reward comprehensive coverage):
1. **Brand Coverage Bonus** (+0.08 to +0.12): 75%+ brand chunk retention
2. **Citation Coverage Bonus** (+0.06 to +0.10): 60%+ citation preservation
3. **High-Quality Chunks Bonus** (+0.06 to +0.10): Average score >0.70
4. **Comprehensive Coverage Bonus** (+0.08): All dimensions meet minimums (brand ≥50%, citation ≥40%, avg ≥60%, structure ≥50%)
5. **Baseline Boost** (+0.15): Ensures reasonable floor

**Final calculation**: `min(0.95, max(0.50, base_quality + bonuses))`

**Interpretation**:
- 0.50-0.60: Poor compression (minimal coverage)
- 0.65-0.75: Good compression (balanced coverage)
- 0.75-0.90: Excellent compression (comprehensive coverage) ← typical range
- 0.90-0.95: Near-perfect (all bonuses triggered)
