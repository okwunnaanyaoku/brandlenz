## Final Delivery Checklist
- [ ] All 7 phases complete
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Performance requirements met (<8s response time)
- [ ] Cost requirements met (<$0.05 per query)
- [ ] Token reduction target met (65%)
- [ ] Extraction accuracy target met (95%)
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Production ready
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] API keys validated

- [ ] Final code quality scan complete

## Lessons Learned
- Minimum chunk sizes can limit achievable compression ratios; fallback logic is essential.
- Tenacity 8+ treats `Retrying` as callable; unwrap `RetryError` for clearer failures.
- Prompt grounding benefits from explicit reference mapping to avoid hallucinated citations.
- Cite parsing should surface meaningful errors when references go missing.
- Citation extraction must normalize URLs and handle partial inputs gracefully.

## Risk Register
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| API rate limits | Medium | High | Implement rate limiting and caching |
| Token costs exceed budget | Low | Medium | Monitor usage and optimize compression |
| Extraction accuracy below target | Low | High | Use multiple validation techniques |
| Integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing at each phase |
